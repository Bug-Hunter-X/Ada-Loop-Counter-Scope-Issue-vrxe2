This example demonstrates a common error in Ada programming where the loop counter's scope is misunderstood. After exiting the loop prematurely, attempting to use the loop counter 'I' outside its scope yields incorrect results.
The solution modifies the code to check for the presence of the value within the loop itself and avoids using the loop counter after exiting the loop.
